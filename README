CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people or AI software, except for the resources explicitly
mentioned in the CS 455 Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my
solution or parts of it with other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

MWM
----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

Received some general coding help from Suvi and Hanchen during office hours.
Received some coding concept help from Sathiya for BookshelfKeeperProg.

----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

Began to convert parts of main method to static methods, but ran out of time.
BookshelfKeeper is submitted as is with completed static methods, and seemingly
works correctly/passes all tests.
I was also hoping add more static methods to completely handle all
pick/put/end cases.

----------------------------------------------
ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

Extra credit:
This submitted (should) also work for duplicate book heights, while using the
minimum amount of mutator operations for the contained Bookshelf.
